# 🧠 Text Generator using Markov Chains

![image[(https://github.com/bhautik2005/PRODIGY_GA_03/blob/eae7b437d91bb059387dc25c9ad24cee50996e20/Screenshot%202025-07-12%20175926.png)

## 📌 Description

This project implements a simple **text generation algorithm using Markov Chains**. It creates a statistical model that predicts the next word based on the previous words (n-grams). You can use it to generate new, synthetic text resembling the style of the input.

## 🚀 Features

- Word-level Markov Chain
- N-gram configurable (default: bigram)
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Text generation of custom length

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

You can install any required packages via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
But this project uses only built-in libraries: random, re, collections.

▶️ How to Run
Add your training text in input.txt.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
You’ll see generated text based on the input file.

🛠️ Customize
Change n=2 to n=3 in build_markov_chain() for trigram models.

Modify length=100 in generate_text() to change output size.
